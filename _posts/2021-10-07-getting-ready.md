There's still no water in my tank, but I'm getting closer to filling it up.
I've got filtered water and more pieces connected in the sump.

## Pure water
Now that the plumbing is done, I immediately wanted to prepare a big reservoir of filtered water.
Unfortunately the RODI unit was misbehaving a bit, and what should have been a 0ppm stream coming out was closer to 5ppm.
The number of trips to Home Depot has been comical, first trying to find an appropriate trash can with wheels (had to check three separate stores), then deciding I need to change one of the RODI canisters, requiring some funky specialized wrench.

In the end I got a nice 20 gallon Brute trash can with the fancy wheel base (don't forget to turn to lock in into place), and the RODI is pumping out a 0ppm trickle.
I did end up replacing the DI canister media, which was pretty straightforward.
Even after replacing it, the output was more than 0ppm, which I fixed by really evening out the media on the canister, washing out the spongy disc, and making sure the connection was snug after screwing it back in.
I think I didn't have to replace the media at all, and probably just needed to fix the connection, or tap the canister on the counter a bit.

## Rocks
I've been playing around a bit with how I'd like to arrange my rocks.
I'm considering gluing them together with paste, but I might be able to just have them balanced against each other.
I think I like my practice configuration.
It seems the way to make things cool is to have the larger structures in the back, with smaller bits towards the front.
You're also supposed to take care not to have things too close to the wall or you'll create an impossible to clean region in the tank where all sorts of funky stuff will grow.

## More machinery
I've also been installing more components into the sump.
The main one I worked on is the protein skimmer, which was easy to [set up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSrD8CXcdWg).
I also placed the wavemaker on the back side of the tank, and attached the lamp, which I'll talk about more later.

I'm trying to keep the cable clutter to a minimum, but there's a lot of stuff going on in the sump already, I don't really know how where the dosing pump and reactor are going to fit, *and* have space for a refugium with a lamp?
I wonder how the previous owner managed.
