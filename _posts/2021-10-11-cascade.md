I made a lot of progress all at once this weekend.
There's water in the tank, there's rocks in the tank, there's sand in the tank.
The water is circulating, the wave maker is spinning, and the protein skimmer is bubbling away.
The lamp is attached now too, but I'm no dealing with it yet

I struggled a bit with where to put the heaters.
First I tried the sump, but it felt too crowded.
Then I attached them in the back wall of the aquarium, which I thought looked fine, but was critiqued for.
Eventually I got them back into the sump, and it does look a lot nicer.

## Salty
I had purchased some fancy probiotic salt from my local fish store, but as it turns out, I already had a humongous bucket of salt intended for corals, so I returned it.
I also bought a fancy refractometer to measure the salinity and temperature of water.
It was very easy to calibrate given the 35ppt samples they provide, and I tried my hand at making a few gallons of salt water.
I marked the level of a bucket with painters tape and added a total of 694g of salt, which got me a little saltier than I would have liked.

## Pump it
Rather than create the saltwater in buckets or containers, I thought it'd be easiest to add salt to the aquarium itself.
In order to transfer all the water from the Brute trash can, I got a standard looking utility pump that connects with a garden hose.

I really like these clamps to hold the hose in place, which you really need, because this pump was sucking the water a lot faster and forcefully than I anticipated!
I wish there was a switch or dial to control it, but as far as I can tell, if it's plugged in, it's *on*.

I'm also really glad I decided to read the tank manual before the water level started to cascade into the overflow.
They recommended adding a small amount of water to the overflow first, to make sure there are no leaks.
I had leaks.
The pipes that screw in from the top needed to be tightened, because I had accidentally loosened them while tightening the connections on the bottom, which are upside down, reversing the tightening direction.

Hearing the water drain into the sump was a bit scary, but there were no spills.
I also understand now that with the return pump turned off, the water level in the sump will be too high, but nowhere near high enough to overflow.
As long as I don't stupidly overfill the tank with water, nothing catastrophic will happen in the event of a power failure.

The only nightmare scenario I can imagine is the hose that connects the return pump to the return pipe slides off of the pipe, and water just pumps outside of the sump, spilling everywhere.
Let's hope that never happens, there's a zip tie there so it's fine... right?

## Squeegee
Once there was water I used the fancy magnet razor cleaner to shave off a bit of filth from the inside of my tank.
It's quite satisfying to use, and those magnets are really strong.

## Keep pumping
The tank is supposed to circulate a bit under 600gph from what I read, so it's time to turn the return pump on.
Doing so caused a whole bunch of crap that had been flaking off of the inside of the plumbing to come shooting out, which was pretty gross.
Just leaving the tank running a while seems to do the trick though, and the filter sock that's actually just a bunch of polyfill started catching a whole bunch of grime.

Once the water was cycling, the tank made a continuous gurgling sound.
There's a knob on one of the drain pipes to restrict flow of water into the sump, helping bring the overflow box level up, but it also balances with the flow rate of the return pump.
The pump model I have can do over 1000gph, so I had the knob set to 50%.
Turning the dial just a small amount really affects the water level of the tank, and I was eventually able to get it stable and silent by increasing the flow rate a bit over 50% power.

## Pieces in motion
I activated the protein skimmer, wave maker, and heaters, and filled up the auto top off with DI water.

The protein skimmer is really cool.
You can control the water level in the column, as well as the air flow into it.
It basically injects a whole bunch of bubbles to create foam that you can trap in a collection cup.
The foam drags whatever nasty stuff is floating around or dissolved in the water, and leaves all the residue in the collection as the bubbles pop.
It's a bit like making sea foam, then letting the foam "pop" until only a bunch of crap is left, which you can then discard.
The sump is turned off now though, since it interferes with the tank cycle, where I'm trying to promote a fish friendly biome to take over.

The wave maker can be a bit tricky to stick properly, since the magnetic plate isn't fixed to the "filter" cover that goes over the propeller.
It came in handy for creating turbulent flow near the base of the tank, which helped mix the salt up more quickly.

I also verified that the float valve does indeed work, and when the water level in the chamber with the return pump gets low, water will trickle down into it from the top off container.

## Rock it
I spent a really long time arranging rocks in the aquarium, aka _aquascaping_.
I'll skip over all the ugly things and just show what I decided on.
Rocks first, sand second, or you'll be building on something that will likely collapse later.
Speaking of collapsing, I didn't glue anything, I hope it doesn't collapse later.
I think it looks a bit empty right now, but I didn't have more rocks, and I think it might be good to leave some space.
I'm hoping it looks properly full once there's actual animals and corals in there.
If not, I should be able to fill it up.
There isn't as much space as it seems though, because I wanted to have a small island for aggressive coral, and also leave a nice space between the rocks and the glass.

Next comes the sand ,pretty straightforward.
This is fancy live sand.
I cut a corner and dumped it into the aquarium.
Turns out it comes with little packets of bacteria stuff that you're supposed to mix into the water, so I did that too.
Two bags of it.

I did a really bad job distributing it uniformly, and there's not enough water flow at the bottom to make the sand move.
I redistributed the sand by putting a chunk of hose in the tank, and blowing into it, forcing bursts of water out of the bottom that moved the sand around.
Probably a really dumb way to do it, but it worked pretty well.

I also bought some live porous rock cube things from the fish store and dumped them right into the sump.
They're supposed to provide a high surface area for my bacteria to grow, which [will scrub out](https://www.thereeftank.com/threads/dosing-bacteria-%E2%80%93-is-it-necessary.135780/) nitrogen based by products.

Lastly, I put the heaters in the sump.
All those cables are driving me crazy still, but it's manageable for now.

The tank was cloudy for a while, but it cleared up in the end!
