The tank is set up and it's just sitting there in my living room.
Right now it's just a stupid glass box on a cabinet.
First thing I decided to tackle was the plumbing.
I need to install all the components in the reef tank/sump itself, but also need to get the RODI filter running somehow.

## Sump
The general assembly of the tank parts was very easy, since it comes ready to go for idiots like me.
I just followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgIbnfJVk98), and got all the pipes in.

There's there's three pipes that connect the tank to the sump.
The leftmost one transfers water from the sump back into the tank.
The other two are the main drain pipe, and an emergency drain pipe.
As far as I can tell, the main pipe will slurp most of the water and its opening will be submerged.
The emergency drain is used to fix the water level of the aquarium, by adjusting its height.
I don't really understand how to prevent a catastrophe in the event that my return pump dies and water can only flow down, so that's something to keep in mind.

The drain pipes direct water into the sump below.
The sump has a bunch of manifolds that will allow water to cascade into the next section once the level reaches the required height.
First it flows into a coarse filter ("sock filter"), which will collect large chunks of crap.
I won't be using a sock filter though, instead I'll be trying some cheap pillow filling material that was recommended by the aquarium shop that's been siphoning money from my bank account.
Next it goes to a protein skimmer, which I haven't set up yet.
After that I believe I can put a bioreactor, which I also haven't set up.
I don't really know that the bioreactor is all that necessary, but the previous owner included it in the pack, so I figure I might as well go for it.
I think it's supposed to really clean out the water nicely.
The next stage is just a flow into some sponge like region to get rid of bubbles, before landing in the final chamber, where it gets pumped back up to the tank.

Supposedly you can grow copepods and other stuff inside a "refugium" section of the sump, and I even got a little lamp that's supposed to help with that.
There is also an additional little glass box that sits on top of the drain section ("top off"?).
It connects to the final chamber of the sump and water flows out of it when the water level gets below a threshold that triggers the float valve to open up.

The first snag I hit was connecting the return pump.
I still don't understand how the previous owner secured it, but the barb coming out of the pump was too large for the hose that goes back into the tank.
Looking up the manual of the pump (EFLUX 6010), it seems like it should have come with a smaller connector.
The one that was currently on had a messed up gasket anyway, so I went ahead and ordered replacement parts.

The kit of new parts had a smaller barb, and after dunking the hose in boiling water to make it more pliable, it was straightforward to get a snug connection on the barb.

## RODI
Part of my purchase was a fancy 4 stage filtration unit.
All I know about it is that it's supposed to give me super pure water, and that it conveniently attaches to standard faucets or garden hoses.
Unfortunately my apartment is full of fancy faucets, and there is no hose, so it's impossible to attach it anywhere.
I would have liked to install T-valves under the sink, but that would require the people that own this place to have some normal plumbing where I can easily turn a shut off valve, install an additional piece, and resume the water flow.
I have close to zero experience, but it all seemed incredibly wonky and annoying to work with.
The bathroom sink required some sort of tool to shut the water off, and the kitchen sink had some impossible to turn circular valves.
I ended up opting for the shower, which nobody at Home Depot was willing to help me with.
The plan was to install one of those things that allows you to connect two shower heads that you can toggle between.
One will be the regular shower head, and the other will have a garden hose adapter that I can connect the RODI to.

The amount of time I spent on tools and pieces that did not work is embarrassing.
Even just removing the shower head was a challenge, and I had to buy push lock pliers to do it, because the stupid thing to unscrew has no flat edges, making a wrench (which I also bought) useless.
I got it all installed in the end though, and even used tungsten tape to keep stuff from leaking.
