I made a lot of progress all at once this weekend.
There's water in the tank, there's rocks in the tank, there's sand in the tank.
The water is circulating, the wave maker is spinning, and the protein skimmer is bubbling away.
The lamp is attached now too, but I'm no dealing with it yet

I struggled a bit with where to put the heaters.
First I tried the sump, but it felt too crowded.
Then I attached them in the back wall of the aquarium, which I thought looked fine, but was critiqued for.
Eventually I got them back into the sump, and it does look a lot nicer.
