I don't know much about anything yet, but I would like to have a beautiful reef tank.
I am especially intrigued by the prospect of growing corals, both soft and hard.
The fluorescence they give off is really stunning, and want to create something that will draw me in with fascination when I look at it.

I'm also really intrigued by simbiosis.
I love the idea of having a relatively self sustaining tank, with different critters eating each others poop, and generally keeping things clean and in balance.

This will all be a new experience for me, I've never so much as owned a goldfish, but I've already dropped a good chunk of money on a bunch of equipment, which I'll show how I set up in future posts.

I bought a used Red Sea Reefer 170 from a really cool guy on Facebook marketplace.
The deal included pretty much every component needed for the tank:
* Red Sea Reefer 170
* Protein skimmer
* Return pump (EFLUX 6010)
* Bioreactor
* RODI filtration system (IceCap 4 stage smart RODI)
* Dosing pump
* Lamp for main tank
* Smaller lamp for sump
* A bunch of miscellaneous items, like salt, minerals, hoses, etc

I'll try to remember to give more detailed descriptions of these items as I go, since I don't really know anything about the brands or the specifications.
With a little help from my friends, I was able to bring this rather large item into my apartment and mounted in my living room.
I already dread the day I have to move out of here with it, so I better get this running so I can enjoy it as long as possible.
